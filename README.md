mapboxapi
An R interface to Mapbox APIs and web services

The purpose of {mapboxapi} is to facilitate the use of Mapbox web services for spatial data science tasks in R. Current and future versions of the package allow R users to return Mapbox navigation requests as simple features (sf) objects, convert R objects to Mapbox vector tilesets, and query Mapbox tilesets from R, among other tasks. The package is not a complete wrapper of the API (though new features will continually be added) nor is it an interface to Mapbox GL JS, Mapboxâ€™s web mapping API.

To install from GitHub, then store your Mapbox access token for use in the package:

remotes::install_github("walkerke/mapboxapi")

# Get your access token from your Mapbox account and save it in R; save a public token,

# secret token, or both with successive calls to mb_access_token()

mapboxapi::mb_access_token("pk.eyzdl....", install = TRUE)
More thorough documentation will be coming as I develop the package. In the meantime, take a look at the following examples:

Example 1: Building a routing app with Shiny and mb_directions()
library(shiny)
library(mapdeck)
library(mapboxapi)

# Set up a sidebar panel with text boxes for origin and destination,

# and a placeholder to print out the driving instructions

ui <- fluidPage(
sidebarPanel(
textInput("origin_text", label = "Origin",
placeholder = "Type an address or place name"),
textInput("destination_text", label = "Destination",
placeholder = "Type an address or place name"),
actionButton("action", "Show me the route!"),
htmlOutput("instructions"),
width = 3
),
mainPanel(
mapdeckOutput(outputId = "map", width = "100%", height = 600)
)
)

# Set up reactive elements to generate routes when the action button is clicked,

# then map the routes and print out the driving directions

server <- function(input, output) {

output$map <- renderMapdeck({
mapdeck(token = Sys.getenv("MAPBOX_PUBLIC_TOKEN"),
style = mapdeck_style("light"),
zoom = 11,
location = c(-97.3034314, 32.7593745))

})

new_route <- eventReactive(input$action, {
    mb_directions(
      origin = input$origin_text,
destination = input$destination_text,
profile = "driving",
output = "sf",
steps = TRUE
)
})

observeEvent(new_route(), {

    mapdeck_update(map_id = "map") %>%
      clear_path(layer_id = "new_route") %>%
      add_path(data = new_route(), stroke_width = 75,
              layer_id = "new_route", update_view = TRUE,
              focus_layer = TRUE)

    output$instructions <- renderUI({
      HTML(paste0(
        paste("&bull;", new_route()$instruction, sep = ""),
        collapse = "<br/>"))
    })

})

}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

Example 2: render large datasets as scalable vector tiles with tippecanoe
library(mapboxapi)
library(mapdeck)
library(httr)

# Get the Microsoft buildings data for Texas and unzip

GET("https://usbuildingdata.blob.core.windows.net/usbuildings-v1-1/Texas.zip",
write_disk("Texas.zip", overwrite = TRUE), progress())

unzip("Texas.zip")

# Use tippecanoe to make a dynamic .mbtiles file that visualizes large data appropriately

# at any zoom level. sf objects can also be used as input!

# (requires installing tippecanoe on your machine separately first)

tippecanoe(input = "Texas.geojson",
output = "Texas.mbtiles",
layer_name = "texas_buildings")

# Upload the generated tileset to your Mapbox account (requires a Mapbox secret access token

# to be set as an environment variable)

upload_tiles(input = "Texas.mbtiles", username = "kwalkertcu",
tileset_id = "TX_buildings",
multipart = TRUE)

# Head over to Mapbox Studio when the upload is done (check the status with

# `check_upload_status()`) and add it to a style. When you've styled it, bring it back

# into R with mapdeck by referencing the style ID:

mapdeck(token = Sys.getenv("MAPBOX_PUBLIC_TOKEN"),
style = "mapbox://styles/kwalkertcu/ckaf9qxim1pyk1io7r2e8exj2/draft",
zoom = 6,
location = c(-98.7382803, 31.7678448))

Example 3: a research workflow to determine how median gross rent varies by distance from downtown
library(mapboxapi)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(tigris)
library(sf)
library(crsuggest)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)

# Grab median gross rent data from the 2014-2018 ACS for the Twin Cities metro

county_names <- c("Hennepin", "Ramsey", "Anoka", "Washington",
"Dakota", "Carver", "Scott")

tc_rent <- get_acs(geography = "tract",
variables = "B25064_001",
state = "MN",
county = county_names,
geometry = TRUE)

# Find the right coordinate system to use; in this case we'll use 26993

print(suggest_top_crs(tc_rent, units = "m"))

# Remove water areas - there are a lot in Minnesota! - to help ensure that a point in a

# given Census tract will be routable

tc_water <- county_names %>%
map(~area_water("MN", .x)) %>%
rbind_tigris() %>%
mutate(pct = percent_rank(AWATER)) %>%
filter(pct >= 0.95) %>%
st_union() %>%
st_transform(26993)

tc_rent_points <- tc_rent %>%
st_transform(26993) %>%
st_difference(tc_water) %>%
st_point_on_surface()

# Determine the location of downtown (apologies to St. Paul, purposes of illustration here)

downtown_mpls <- mb_geocode("Minneapolis City Hall, Minneapolis MN")

# Use mb_matrix() to calculate driving time from all Twin Cities Census tracts to downtown

time_to_downtown <- mb_matrix(origins = tc_rent_points,
destinations = downtown_mpls) %>%
as.vector()

tc_rent$time <- time_to_downtown

# Visualize how rent varies by travel time from downtown with ggplot2

ggplot(tc_rent, aes(x = time, y = estimate)) +
geom_smooth() +
scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
labs(x = "Travel time to downtown Minneapolis (in minutes)",
y = "Median gross rent in Census tract",
title = "Median rent by drive-time to downtown Minneapolis",
subtitle = "Census tracts in the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area",
caption = "Data sources: Mapbox Directions API, 2014-2018 ACS") +
theme_minimal()
